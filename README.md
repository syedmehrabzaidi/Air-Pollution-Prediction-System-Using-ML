# Air-Pollution-Prediction-System-Using-ML
The proposed system depicts various strategies utilized for forecast of
Air Quality Index (AQI) utilizing supervised machine learning procedures. The system examines machine learning algorithm for air quality index by computing algorithm accuracy which will bring about the best precision. Moreover, the system exhibits different machine learning accuracy figures from the given dataset with assessment order report which recognizes the perplexity lattice. The outcome shows the adequacy of machine learning suggested calculation method that can be contrasted and best exactness with accuracy, Recall and F1 Score. The air pollution database contains data for each state of Pakistan. Supervised machine learning algorithms, logistic regression, decision tree, support vector machine, random forest tree, Naive Bayes theorem and K-nearest neighbor are compared and evaluated.
